What did I do last time?
	-Implementing JShell which prompts user for input, 
	and runs functions based on input
	-Implementing CmdManager which manages all commands 
	and finds correct one to run
	-Created exception for when command doesn't exist
	-Worked on CRC cards

What do I plan to do now?
	-Unit tests for JShell and CmdManager

Am I blocked on anything?
	-None
