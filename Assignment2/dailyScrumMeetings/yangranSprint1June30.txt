What did I do last time?
    - Discussing and writing the product backlog
    - Planning to decide for the role in sprint 1
    - Discussing the design choices in the project (e.g. file system, command organization, etc)
    - Decide the implementation of file system including the structure of File and Directory classes

What do I plan to do now?
    - Build the file system that's able to keep track of the root directory and retrieve file/directory given path
    - Update CRC cards to be consistent the lasted design

Am I blocked on anything?
    - We are still deciding whether to use hashmap or linked list to implement directory contents structure
