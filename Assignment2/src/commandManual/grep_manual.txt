grep [-R] REGEX PATH...
If –R is not supplied, print any lines containing REGEX in PATH, which must
be a file. If –R is supplied, and PATH is a directory, recursively traverse the 
directory and, for all lines in all files that contain REGEX, print the path to the 
file (including the filename), then a colon, then the line that contained REGEX.
