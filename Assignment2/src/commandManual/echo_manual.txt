echo STRING [> OUTFILE]

If OUTFILE is not provided, print STRING on the shell. Otherwise, put STRING 
into file OUTFILE. STRING is a string of characters surrounded by double 
quotation marks. This creates a new file if OUTFILE does not exists and 
erases the old contents if OUTFILE already exists. In either case, the only 
thing in OUTFILE should be STRING.

echo STRING >> OUTFILE
Like the previous command, but appends instead of overwrites.
